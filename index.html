    <p id="text">
        Treaty 4 was signed on <strong>September 15, 1874</strong>, with people from British Queen Victoria joining with the Cree, Assiniboine, and Saulteaux peoples. 
        This process took six days to complete.<p id="text">
			The treaty was signed at <span style="color:grey; font-weight: bold;">Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan</span>,
									which remains an important historical site today.</p>

    <p id="text">
        The flag has four sections that represent not only the Treaty aspect but also many aspects of community, life, and roles. 
        This has been used as an icon in Treaty 4 Territory for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. 
        The Treaty aspect shows the creation of the promise, which can be seen in each section â€“ 
        <strong>"For As Long As The Sun Shines, Grass Grows, and Waters Flow"</strong>, which is commonly said in Treaty acknowledgments in schools across Winnipeg and Manitoba.

                <p class="highlights">Treaty 4 covers a large area of southern Saskatchewan.</p>
                <p id="text">
                    The land in Treaty 4 were originally home to Indigenous people who lived off the land, 
                    relying on the natural area for food, shelter, and trade. The signing of the treaty changed 
                    how land was used and led to the creation of reserves. Today, many communities in this area continue 
                    to honor Treaty 4 through education, cultural events, and land acknowledgments.

<h3>How Treaty 4 Affects People Today</h3>
<p class="treaty-text">
    Treaty 4 continues to play a major role in making Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations in Canada. 
    It set the base for Indigenous rights, goverment, and land negotiations. 
    Many schools and communities honor Treaty 4 through land acknowledgments, cultural celebrations, and educational work .
    However, there are live discussions about treaty rights, resource sharing, and agreements efforts to ensure fair work of the agreements.
