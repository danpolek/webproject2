            <p>
                The land in Treaty 4 was originally home to Indigenous people who lived off the land, 
                relying on the natural area for food, shelter, and trade. The signing of the treaty changed 
                how land was used and led to the creation of reserves.

                Treaty 4 continues to play a major role in Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations in Canada. 
                It set the base for Indigenous rights, government, and land negotiations. 
                Many schools and communities honor Treaty 4 through land acknowledgments, cultural celebrations, and educational work.
