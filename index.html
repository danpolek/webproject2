    <h2><i><b>TREATY 4 GATHERING</b></i></h2>

    <p id="text">
        Treaty 4 was signed on <strong>September 15, 1874</strong>, with people from British Queen Victoria joining with the Cree, Assiniboine, and Saulteaux peoples. 
        This process took six days to complete.
    </p>
    <p id="text">
        The treaty was signed at <span style="color:grey; font-weight: bold;">Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan</span>,
        which remains an important historical site today.

    <p id="text">
        The flag has four sections that represent not only the Treaty aspect but also many aspects of community, life, and roles. 
        The Treaty aspect shows the creation of the promise, which can be seen in each section â€“
        <strong>"For As Long As The Sun Shines, Grass Grows, and Waters Flow"</strong>, which is commonly said in Treaty acknowledgments in schools across Winnipeg and Manitoba.

        <p class="highlights">Treaty 4 covers a large area of southern Saskatchewan.</p>
        <p id="text">
            The land in Treaty 4 was originally home to Indigenous people who lived off the land, 
            relying on the natural area for food, shelter, and trade. The signing of the treaty changed 
            how land was used and led to the creation of reserves.

        Treaty 4 continues to play a major role in Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations in Canada.
