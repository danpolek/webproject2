    <h2><i><b>TREATY 4 GATHERING</b></i></h2>

    <p id="text">
        <span style="color: #333;" >Treaty 4</span> was signed on <strong>September 15, 1874</strong>, with people from British Queen Victoria joining with the Cree, Assiniboine, and Saulteaux peoples. 
        This process took six days to complete.

    </div>

    <p id="text">
        The flag has four sections that represent not only the Treaty aspect but also many aspects of community, life, and roles. 
        This has been adopted as an icon in Treaty 4 Territory for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. 
        The Treaty aspect represents the breadth of the promise, which can be seen in each section â€“ 
        <strong>"For As Long As The Sun Shines, Grass Grows, and Waters Flow"</strong>, which is commonly said in Treaty acknowledgments in schools across Winnipeg and Manitoba.

    <h2>Treaty 4 Location and Coverage</h2>
<p id="text">
    Treaty 4 covers a large area of <strong>southern Saskatchewan</strong>, extending into 
    <strong>western Manitoba</strong> and a small part of <strong>Alberta</strong>. It includes 
    over <strong>195,000 square kilometers</strong> of land. The treaty was signed at 
    <strong>Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan</strong>, which remains an important historical site today.

<h3>Areas Included in Treaty 4</h3>
<ul id="text">
    <li>Southern <strong>Saskatchewan</strong> (including Regina, Moose Jaw, Yorkton, and Fort Qu'Appelle)</li>
    <li><strong>Western Manitoba</strong> (bordering Saskatchewan)</li>
    <li>A small section of <strong>Alberta</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>First Nations in Treaty 4 Territory</h3>
<p id="text">
    Treaty 4 includes <strong>35 First Nations</strong> from the Cree, Saulteaux (Ojibwe), and Assiniboine peoples. 
    Some of these nations are:
</p>
<ul id="text">
    <li>Cowessess First Nation</li>
    <li>Piapot First Nation</li>
    <li>Ochapowace First Nation</li>
    <li>Pasqua First Nation</li>
    <li>Kahkewistahaw First Nation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why is the Location Important?</h3>
<p id="text">
    The lands within Treaty 4 were originally home to Indigenous peoples who lived off the land, 
    relying on the natural environment for food, shelter, and trade. The signing of the treaty changed 
    how land was used and led to the creation of reserves. Today, many communities in this area continue 
    to honor Treaty 4 through education, cultural events, and land acknowledgments.
