                Treaty 4 was signed on <strong>September 15, 1874</strong>, with British Queen Victoria joining with the Cree, Assiniboine, and Saulteaux peoples. The signing took six days to complete.

                The treaty was signed at <span style="color:grey; font-weight: bold;">Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan</span>, which remains an important historical site today.

            The flag has four sections that represent Treaty agreements and aspects of community and life. It shows the creation of the promise:
            <strong>"For As Long As The Sun Shines, Grass Grows, and Waters Flow"</strong>, a phrase still used in land acknowledgments today.

        <p class="highlights">Treaty 4 covers a large area of southern Saskatchewan.</p>
        <p id="text">
            The land in Treaty 4 was originally home to Indigenous people who lived off the land, 
            relying on the natural area for food, shelter, and trade. The signing of the treaty changed 
            how land was used and led to the creation of reserves.

    <section aria-labelledby="impact-title">
        <h3 id="impact-title">How Treaty 4 Affects People Today</h3>
        <p class="treaty-text">
            Treaty 4 continues to play a major role in Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations in Canada. 
            It set the base for Indigenous rights, government, and land negotiations. 
            Many schools and communities honor Treaty 4 through land acknowledgments, cultural celebrations, and educational work.
