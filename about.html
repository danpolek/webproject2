            <h2>What is Treaty 4?</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Treaty 4 was signed on <strong>September 15, 1874</strong>, between representatives of the British Crown 
                and the Cree, Assiniboine, and Saulteaux nations. The treaty covers much of present-day 
                southern Saskatchewan and parts of Manitoba and Alberta.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The treaty was part of a larger series of agreements made between the Crown and various Indigenous nations 
                across Canada, known as the Numbered Treaties. These treaties were intended to secure peace and shared 
                land usage between Indigenous peoples and settlers moving westward. However, the implementation of these 
                treaties has been a complex and often controversial issue.

            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p class="text">
                The signing of Treaty 4 took place during a period of significant change for Indigenous peoples in Canada. 
                As European settlers moved westward, the Indigenous peoples were faced with pressure to adapt to new 
                governance systems, farming practices, and economic models. The promises made during the treaty discussions 
                were meant to address some of these challenges, including providing land and resources for both settlers and 
                Indigenous peoples.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The treaty negotiations took place in a context of growing tensions, as the Canadian government sought to 
                expand its control over the western territories, while Indigenous nations were grappling with the decline 
                of the bison herds and the pressures of settlement. The promises made during the treaty process were intended 
                to ensure peaceful relations and establish a framework for cooperation between the Crown and Indigenous nations.

            <h2>Why is Treaty 4 Important?</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Treaty 4 established agreements related to land use, education, healthcare, and trade. However, 
                Indigenous perspectives emphasize that many of the treaty promises have not been fully upheld. 
                For example, the treaty included provisions for annuities (annual payments) to be made to Indigenous peoples, 
                as well as the provision of reserve lands. Despite these agreements, many Indigenous communities have faced 
                challenges related to land rights, resource extraction, and inadequate compensation.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Understanding Treaty 4 helps us recognize Indigenous rights and reconciliation efforts today. Many of the issues 
                faced by Indigenous peoples, such as poverty, lack of access to education, and disputes over land and resources, 
                are directly related to the implementation—or lack thereof—of these treaty promises.

            <h2>Indigenous Perspectives on Treaty 4</h2>
            <p class="text">
                For many Indigenous communities, the treaties were not seen as land surrenders, but as agreements that 
                established a relationship of mutual respect and shared governance. Indigenous signatories to the treaties 
                envisioned a partnership with the Crown, where both parties would benefit from the use of the land, while 
                respecting Indigenous ways of life.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The promises of Treaty 4 were intended to support the cultural, spiritual, and economic well-being of 
                Indigenous peoples. However, many argue that these promises have been broken or ignored over time, 
                leading to a legacy of mistrust and unresolved grievances. Modern-day treaty discussions continue, with 
                many Indigenous communities working toward justice, reconciliation, and the fulfillment of the original treaty terms.

            <h2>Treaty 4 Territory Today</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Today, Treaty 4 continues to be recognized in schools, workplaces, and government institutions. 
                Many Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities work together to honor the agreements made 
                and ensure that the treaty’s original intent is respected.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The territory covered by Treaty 4 remains home to many Indigenous communities, and much of the ongoing 
                work surrounding the treaty involves the reclamation of rights and the restoration of relationships 
                between Indigenous peoples and the broader Canadian society. Efforts are ongoing to ensure that treaty 
                obligations are met and that the original intent of the treaty is honored.

            <h2>The Impact of Treaty 4 on Modern Canada</h2>
            <p class="text">
                The legacy of Treaty 4 continues to shape the political, social, and cultural landscape of Canada. It has 
                played a critical role in defining the relationship between Indigenous peoples and the Canadian state. 
                In modern times, Treaty 4 has become a focal point for Indigenous activism, with many groups and 
                organizations advocating for the fulfillment of treaty promises and the rights of Indigenous peoples.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Today, Treaty 4 is part of a larger movement toward reconciliation in Canada, which includes addressing 
                the historical wrongs of colonialism, recognizing Indigenous sovereignty, and working toward a more 
                equitable and just society. Efforts include the recognition of land rights, compensation for broken promises, 
                and the creation of frameworks for meaningful consultation and participation in decision-making.
