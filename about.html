            <h2>What is Treaty 4?</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Treaty 4 was signed on <strong>September 15, 1874</strong>, between representatives of the British Crown 
                and the Cree, Assiniboine, and Saulteaux nations. The treaty covers much of present-day 
                southern Saskatchewan and parts of Manitoba and Alberta.

            <h2>Why is Treaty 4 Important?</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Treaty 4 established agreements related to land use, education, healthcare, and trade. However, 
                Indigenous perspectives emphasize that many of the treaty promises have not been fully upheld. 
                Understanding Treaty 4 helps us recognize Indigenous rights and reconciliation efforts today.

            <h2>Treaty 4 Territory Today</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Today, Treaty 4 continues to be recognized in schools, workplaces, and government institutions. 
                Many Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities work together to honor the agreements made 
                and ensure that the treaty’s original intent is respected.
